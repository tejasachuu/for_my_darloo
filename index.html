      <h2>
        You're special & when I say special I mean very very special to me. Because I have always noticed that I'm not so comfortable with anyone but when it comes to talking with you, sharing with you, I always feel like I don't have limits. You listen to me. You don't judge me don't fear about what you'll think about me. Thanks for shouting at me when I was wrong thanks for fighting for me, thanks for making me realize that I am special to you, important for you & never leaving me when I was worse, don't need anyone else but I just need one person in my life & that's you. Just stay with me always because you're very very special to me & I Love you so much...💖.
        <br />I have Something for you ..Again Thankyou Love
